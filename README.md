### Treasure Hunting Game

The function of this application is for a pirate to navigate a maze using Q-Training and reach an end goal. The system works through epochs learning to take more and more calculated risks.
With the zipped source folder I was able to maintain everything that wasn't the direct training module.

  The code completed by me was the Q-training learning module. This block allowed me to provide logic for the system using the provided code.</br>
  My created code functions as such:</br></br>
  <ul>
    <li>Epochs are established</li>
    <li>Pirate is assigned a cell, the maze is reset, and reset the Game Over status to false</li>
    <li>The game begins and the pirate is randomly assigned a status after every move</li>
      <li>Status for wins, losses, and game over</li>
    <li>Actions are repeated and saved as episodes</li>
    <li>The model is then assigned various data factors</li>
    <li>Losses and wins are then evaluated</li>
  </ul>

  #### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</br>
  The purpose of the computer scientist is to analyze complex software and hardware issues related to a variety of fields including businesses, government, and personal individual matters.</br>
  This is important for the improvement of not only our technology, but also the advancement of our society as a whole. Allowing these scientists manage these issues we can continue to learn and assess various issues such as ethical issues, resource allotment, and others.</br>
  
  #### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  Approaching a computer, or system, related issue should be solved like any issue faced. We must approach it logically, rationally, and patiently.</br>
  <li>
    <ul><b>Patiently</b></br>
    We must realize that change takes time. In orderr to make positive change in the field of computing it's important to take our time to ensure the product meets all of our demands. According to Moore's law, computing speed doubles every two years. But, we as humans don't grow this way, and we need to be congnisant of this.
    </ul>
    <ul><b>Logically and Rationally</b></ul></br>
    A computer system doesn't need to worry about moving productively while remaining in a certain mindset. The human mind experiences many different thoughts, emotions, or feelings. We need to stay grounded and focus on the issues that we are tasked to do. Everybody moves so quickly to push out a product while sometimes skipping steps. This could be ethically, geared towards a bias, or poor user data collection. Ultimately, no matter how great an issue may be. There is no excuse to potentially compromise the user, our ethics, or the product as a whole.
    </ul>
  </li></br>
  
  #### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization?
  Realistically we should prioritize the end user over the organization. As we've seen in the EU, heavy fines and penalties are being implemented to different technology companies under the umbrella within the General Data Protection Regulation passed a few years ago. I think this can benefit everybody involved. Companies must prioritize user data, and analyze safe ethical practices. In return, the user data is safer, and runs less of a risk for compromise. All in all, we must avoid biases, problems pertaining to race, religion, and other categories.
